Documentation for package `did` 
=================================

This is the documentation for the `did` package, the implementation of paper 
*Measuring dissimilarity with diffeomorphism invariance*, by Th√©ophile Cantelobre,
Alessandro Rudi, Carlo Ciliberto and Benjamin Guedj.

The paper introduces a dissimilarity between data spaces (for example between images or time
series) that is invariant by diffeomorphisms. Practically, the dissimilarity between an image
and a rotated version of the same image is close to zero with the dissimilarity we introduce.

This library is a campanion for the paper. The source code is available at LINK, along with sample 
data and scripts (allowing to reproduce the results presented in the paper).

To get started with `did` (installation and first examples), checkout the Getting started page below.
